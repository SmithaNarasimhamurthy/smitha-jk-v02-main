# Risk Identification for Textile Dye Suppliers - Problem-Solving Approach

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive methodology for analyzing news articles related to 10 major textile dye suppliers to identify potential supply chain risks across five key categories.

## Problem Definition
**Objective**: Analyze news articles from 2023-2024 related to 10 textile dye suppliers and classify risks that could impact supply chain operations.

**Target Suppliers**:
1. Welspun Living Limited
2. Teejay Lanka PLC  
3. Arvind Limited
4. Caleres, Inc.
5. Interloop Limited
6. Kitex Garments Limited
7. ThredUp Inc.
8. G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.
9. Mint Velvet
10. White Stuff Limited

## Risk Categories
1. **Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks** (trade wars, tariffs, regulations)
2. **Agricultural and Environmental Risks** (droughts, climate change, crop failures)
3. **Financial and Operational Risks** (bankruptcy, labor strikes, production issues)
4. **Supply Chain and Logistics Risks** (transportation bottlenecks, fuel price hikes)
5. **Market and Competitive Risks** (price fluctuations, competitor actions)

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Extraction and Preprocessing
1. **Data Loading**: Extract news articles from JSON file containing links, titles, content, and metadata
2. **Text Cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, special characters, normalize text
3. **Article Content Extraction**: Process both available article content and extract additional content from URLs where needed
4. **Data Quality Assessment**: Handle missing values, duplicate articles, and inconsistent formatting

### Phase 2: Natural Language Processing Pipeline
1. **Text Tokenization**: Break down articles into meaningful tokens
2. **Named Entity Recognition**: Identify companies, locations, dates, and key entities
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine positive/negative sentiment indicators
4. **Topic Modeling**: Use LDA/BERT to identify key themes in articles
5. **Feature Engineering**: Create TF-IDF vectors, word embeddings, and domain-specific features

### Phase 3: Risk Classification Model Development
1. **Labeled Dataset Creation**: 
   - Manual annotation of sample articles for training
   - Keyword-based labeling for initial dataset creation
   - Use of domain expertise for risk category mapping

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - **Primary Approach**: Fine-tuned BERT for multi-label classification
   - **Alternative Approaches**: 
     - Random Forest with TF-IDF features
     - Support Vector Machine with engineered features
     - Ensemble methods combining multiple approaches

3. **Risk Direction Classification**:
   - Binary classification for each risk: Increased (+ve) vs Decreased (-ve)
   - Sentiment-based features to determine risk direction
   - Temporal analysis for trend identification

### Phase 4: Supplier-Specific Analysis
1. **Individual Supplier Profiling**: Create risk profiles for each of the 10 suppliers
2. **Temporal Risk Tracking**: Analyze risk evolution over 2023-2024 timeframe
3. **Cross-Supplier Risk Correlation**: Identify systemic risks affecting multiple suppliers
4. **Geographic Risk Mapping**: Associate risks with supplier locations and operations

### Phase 5: Visualization and Insights
1. **Risk Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations showing:
   - Risk category distribution per supplier
   - Timeline of risk events
   - Severity and frequency analysis
   - Geographic risk heatmaps

2. **Comparative Analysis**: 
   - Supplier risk benchmarking
   - Industry trend identification
   - Predictive risk indicators

### Phase 6: Results and Deliverables
1. **Structured Output Files**:
   - `supplier_risk_analysis.csv`: Detailed risk scores per supplier
   - `temporal_risk_trends.csv`: Time-series risk data
   - `risk_category_summary.csv`: Aggregated risk insights
   - `article_classifications.csv`: Individual article classifications

2. **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**:
   - Real-time risk monitoring interface
   - Drill-down capabilities by supplier/risk category
   - Export functionality for business users

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Technology Stack
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK/SpaCy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Transformers (HuggingFace), TensorFlow
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Text Processing**: BeautifulSoup, Requests for web scraping
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage

### Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Multi-label Classification**: F1-score, Precision, Recall per category
- **Risk Direction**: Accuracy, ROC-AUC for binary classification
- **Business Metrics**: Risk prediction accuracy, false positive rates
- **Cross-validation**: Time-based splits to ensure temporal validity

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Automated Risk Detection**: System capable of classifying news articles into risk categories with >85% accuracy
2. **Supplier Risk Profiles**: Comprehensive risk assessment for each supplier
3. **Early Warning System**: Identification of emerging risks before they impact operations
4. **Strategic Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for supply chain risk mitigation
5. **Scalable Framework**: Methodology applicable to additional suppliers and risk categories

## Success Criteria
- Successful classification of articles into 5 risk categories
- Clear identification of risk trends and patterns
- Actionable insights for supply chain management
- User-friendly dashboard for business stakeholders
- Comprehensive documentation and reproducible results

This approach ensures a systematic, data-driven methodology for identifying and analyzing supply chain risks while providing actionable insights for business decision-making.
