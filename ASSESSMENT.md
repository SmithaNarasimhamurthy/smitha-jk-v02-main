**Data Science Coding Exercise: Risk Identification for Textile Dye Suppliers**

---

### **Context:**

You are a data scientist working with the Textile and Apparel industry giant. It relies on a global supply chain for its ingredients, including Textile Dyes, which are supplied by 10 major companies worldwide. To ensure a stable supply chain, the company needs to monitor potential risks associated with these suppliers, such as geopolitical issues, environmental challenges, financial instability, logistics disruptions, and market competition.

Your task is to analyze news articles related to these 10 suppliers for the last 2 years (2023 and 2024) and identify risks that could impact the company’s supply chain. The end goal is to provide actionable insights to the company’s supply chain management team, helping them mitigate risks and ensure uninterrupted operations.
